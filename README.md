# HMM
This repository contains Python code of hidden markov model for training parameters using baum-welch algorithm and predictions using viterbi algorithm 

### HMM_BW.py 
This file contains code for baum welch algorithm to train parameters when there are no hidden states observed
The code in this file is largely inspired from the blog - http://www.adeveloperdiary.com/data-science/machine-learning/derivation-and-implementation-of-baum-welch-algorithm-for-hidden-markov-model/
